The Prize

One lucky winner will get the chance to win

Php5,000!


Instructions
 

Write a class that implements the Compression <String> interface and write your own implementation with its two methods.

The input can be any String of valid utf-8 characters.  At a minimum, your routine must be able to compress the sample source String provided. We will also be testing your routine on other Strings as well.

The compression should be lossless--meaning the decompressed byte[] must be exactly the same as the original source String. Download the compressor file here.

Submit your entry to bold2code@voyagerinnovation.com with your name and mobile number as the subject line (Format: NAME_MOBILE NUMBER).
